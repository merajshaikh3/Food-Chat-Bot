# Food Chat Bot

This project is a food ordering chatbot that uses Dialogflow to interact with users, MySQL to store menu details, and FastAPI as the web development framework. The chatbot can handle various intents such as creating an order, tracking an order, and canceling an order. This project is implemented by following the [YouTube tutorial by codebasics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e5pQqBvGco&ab_channel=codebasics).
